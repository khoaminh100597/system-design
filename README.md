# System Design

## What is System Design

System Design is the process of designing the *architecture*, *components*, and *interfaces* for a system so that it meets the end-users requirements

## Steps for approaching

1. Understand the requirements:
    - This includes gathering information about the problem space, performance requirements, scalibility needs, and security concerns
2. Identify the major components:
    - This includes determining relationships between different components and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the system
3. Choose appropriate techonology:
    - Choose hardware and software platforms, database, programming languages, and tools
4. Define the interface:
    - Define APIs, protocols, and data formats
5. Design the data model:
    - Design the schema for the database, the structure of data files, and the data flow between components
6. Consider scalibility and performance:
    - Consider load balancing, caching and database optimization
7. Test and validate the design:
    - Test the system by realistic data and use cases, and make changes as needed to address any issues that arise
8. Deploy and maintain the system:
    - Fix bugs, update components, and add features as needed

## Advantages of System Design

1. Better underestanding of requirements
2. Improved efficiency
3. Better scalibility
4. Improved maintainability
5. Better communication

## Disadvantages:

1. Time-consuming
2. Cost
3. Requires expertise
4. Limited flexibility
